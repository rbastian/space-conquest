    """
    Test spec-compliant behavior: Two players send fleets to same NPC star.
    PvP combat occurs first, then winner vs NPC.

    Setup:
    - Star J: NPC, 2 defenders (weakened from previous battle)
    - P1 fleet: 3 ships arriving at J
    - P2 fleet: 4 ships arriving at J

    Expected Sequence (NEW SPEC):
    - Phase 1 (PvP): 3 vs 4 → P2 wins with 2 survivors (loses ceil(3/2) = 2)
    - Phase 2 (NPC): 2 vs 2 → Tie, mutual destruction
    - Result: J becomes NPC-controlled with 0 ships

    Old Behavior (BUG):
    - Combined attack: 7 ships vs 2 NPC
    - Attackers win, lose ceil(2/2) = 1 ship → 6 survivors
    - P1 gets 3, P2 gets 3
    - Then PvP: 3 vs 3 = tie, mutual destruction
    - Result: J unowned, 0 ships
