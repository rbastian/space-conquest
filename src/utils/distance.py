    """Calculate Chebyshev distance between two points.

    Chebyshev distance is the maximum absolute difference of coordinates.
    Also known as chessboard or Lâˆž distance. In game terms, this represents
    the number of turns needed to travel between stars, where diagonal
    movement costs the same as orthogonal movement.

    Args:
        x1: X coordinate of first point
        y1: Y coordinate of first point
        x2: X coordinate of second point
        y2: Y coordinate of second point

    Returns:
        Chebyshev distance between the two points

    Examples:
        >>> chebyshev_distance(0, 0, 3, 3)
        3  # Diagonal is same cost as orthogonal
        >>> chebyshev_distance(0, 0, 5, 0)
        5  # Horizontal movement unchanged
